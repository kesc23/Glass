I created this for helping me to debug and add functionalities in my programs.<br>
It turned out to be one way of helping others to build their PHP programs the way they wanted to, without any hassle.

## Getting Started:

Once you've downloaded Glass from Github, you can put it *preferentially* in your main folder and you can simply call it in your index.php:

```php
# Example of an index.php

require glass/glass.php;
```

In earlier versions you needed to require glass/config.php and then call `glassInit();`<br>
Now, all you need to do is just require the file as shown above.

From now on for better use in glass debbuging functions, if you need to require/include a file inside your script you can use:

```php
glassInclude( 'filename.php', 'path/to/file/' );
# Or
glassRequire( 'filename.php', 'path/to/file/' );
```

They do seem equal, following the same differences shared between require and include functions in php but they have a debugging functionallity.
